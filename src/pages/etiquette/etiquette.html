		  <ion-card-header>"Just a game"</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    The key thing to remember is that it's just a game. Things do get occasionally heated but it's important to remember to take nothing personally and hold no grudges!

		  <ion-card-header>Treat every game like your first</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    Played with a player before? Were they a wolf last time? Try to forget all previous games and start every game afresh. Don't assume previous enemies are still your enemies in a different game :)

		  <ion-card-header>All discussion is public</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    No private conversations - If you say something, everyone in the game should hear it and be able to act on the same information.

		  <ion-card-header>No peeking</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    When you are asked to close your eyes to vote or sleep, don't peek. It's technically cheating to gain information you shouldn't have.

		  <ion-card-header>Voting and Night noise</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    Try to ignore any sounds you hear when your eyes are closed (People voting or acting at night). You should only act on information you are given verbally other players or by the moderator.

		  <ion-card-header>Voting</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    When it comes to voting, if you can vote, you HAVE to vote, and can only vote once per round of votes.<br> 
		    Everyone votes with their eyes closed<br>
		    If possible put your hand up high so the mod can clearly see it.<br>
		    If the votes need repeating, please vote for the same person a second time.

		  <ion-card-header>Lying</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    Lying is a key feature of the game. Bad characters will want to lie about who they are, so they aren't burned by the village.<br>
		    In the same vein, good characters may want to lie about who they are, so that they're less of a target for bad characters.

		  <ion-card-header>Sharing Information</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    A lot of games can be won or lost by sharing information at the right time. You can share any information you have (including your role) at any point but it might make you more of a target. <br>
		    On the other hand, you can hold onto any information you have in order to try and catch someone out. <br>
		    It's all a gamble though - if you die before sharing something crucial, your team may never find the information out.

		  <ion-card-header>Death</ion-card-header>
		  <ion-card-content>
		    When you are killed in the game, you can read the list of everyone's roles, keep your eyes open to watch the whole game.<br>
		    When dead, you are not allowed to talk or signal the living players.<br>
		    If you die and your team wins, you win!
