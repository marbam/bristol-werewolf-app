<p>There is a lot to take in when playing Werewolf. Even so, don't panic - It takes most people a few games to get into the swing of things, and everything you need to play will be explained to you before, or during your first game!</p>
<p>Werewolf is a "Social Deduction" game. Everyone is given a role - be it a good character or a bad character, and the aim of the game is to eliminate the other team(s) before they eliminate your team.</p>

<p> To simplify everything as much as possible, we've divided this into a handful of pages - click a button below to start learning, or click 'Roles' to get more info about all the different characters</p>
