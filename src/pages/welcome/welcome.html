<p>Welcome to the initial - basic - Bristol Werewolf app. We're a group who play the social deduction game "Werewolf" in Bristol. </p>

<p>It's a game involving ten to thirty people in a room, all given roles. If you're a werewolf, you need stay hidden and eat all of the villagers before they get you. If you're a villager, you have to hunt the wolves before you get eaten.</p>

<p>This app was created to give a brief outline of the different roles you may be given when you play. Click "Roles" below to take a look at the list!</p>
